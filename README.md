# NBA Gacha :basketball:

## A gacha game with NBA players built in Java for the CPSC 210 project

### How it works
Assemble your best team of 15 NBA players of different positions by rolling for players in the gacha. Face off against
other teams to see whose team is better!

### Who will use it
This game will interest people that are fans of basketball and have experience with gacha games/fantasy sports.
It provides a twist on the traditional fantasy basketball game and incorporates the excitement of rolling with
gacha games.

### Why this project interests me
I have enjoyed watching and playing basketball for a couple of years now. Every year, I enjoy playing NBA fantasy
against my friends and see who can assemble the best roster and poke fun at those whose team falls apart. I was
inspired to make this a gacha game as I've seen discord bots which were essentially gacha games and thought it would
be cool if I could make something similar. So I combined my interest for basketball with the elements of a gacha game
and this idea was born.
